## Resources for understanding Randomization Inference 

While Imbens & Rubin (2015) (pdf copy [here](https://github.com/andrewzeitlin/RI_CI/tree/master/resources)) is the canonical text on RI, here's a list of primers and gentler introductions to the topic that may be useful.

1. Donald Green (of [Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, & Interpretation (2012)](https://www.amazon.com/Field-Experiments-Design-Analysis-Interpretation/dp/0393979954))) has a simple and effective introduction along with R code [here](https://egap.org/methods-guides/10-things-randomization-inference). 

2. Matthew Blackwell ([website](https://www.mattblackwell.org/)) has a really useful set of [lecture notes](https://www.mattblackwell.org/files/teaching/s05-fisher.pdf) on RI that lays out the material succinctly and even goes into test statistics and confidence intervals.

3. Jason Kerwin has a blog [entry](https://jasonkerwin.com/nonparibus/2017/09/25/randomization-inference-vs-bootstrapping-p-values/) on differentiating RI from bootstrapping. 

4. The [DIME Wiki](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Randomization_Inference) is yet another simple and concise piece on the concept of RI, how to calculate it, and implications for experimental design.


There's certainly more material and references out there that I am not aware of. If something comes my way, I'll add it. In the meantime, these should suffice to get started and build on the understanding.
